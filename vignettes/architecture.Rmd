This guide describes the general architecture of the Online SuperLearner. 

# Data
In order to be able to deal with both static data (i.e., data that is available upfront, `data.tables` or `data.frames`) and to be able to deal with streaming data (i.e., data that comes in as a stream, for example from kafka), a small architecture of wrapping objects is created. This architecture looks as follows:

IMAGE HERE, see the `vignettes/onlineSuperLearner-data.pdf` file.

The reason for this abstraction is to allow the same methods (`getNext` and `getNextN`) to be used for both `data.frames` (or `data.tables`) and data streams. What the Online SuperLearner does is treat both instances of data as streaming data.
